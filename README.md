### G'day ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub page. I'm a software developer and University student based in Melbourne, Victoria. Australia!
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my personal website. The repository is locked for now, but it will be open source once the site is launched!

I have experience in:
- Java (IntelliJ, Android Studio)
- Python
- HTML/CSS
- SQL
- Pycharm
- VSCode
- Oracle

And that knowledge will continue to grow!

Need to contact me? You can message me on  https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-roche-5747031b5/ and at jamieroche12@outlook.com

Have a great day, and thanks for exploring my GitHub!
